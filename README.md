# Tic-Tac-Toe

A GUI-based tic-tac-toe game. 

## Description

In these trying times, people need some kind of mental stimulation to decompress the stresses involved in everyday life. 
This game allows two close members of a household (most likely family members) to play a time-tested game and connect together.
